# vortex_generator

This notebook was created for students in the Experimental Turbulence course at Ontario Tech University. The aim is to generate a database for POD analysis of the synthetic vorticity field. For this, a Burgers-Rott model is used. The position of the vortex center varies randomly according to a normal distribution and the oscillation of its diameter follows a periodic function that can be modified. The code also enables the mesh size and the number of snapshots to be adjusted. 

Details can be found in the notebook and in the code comments.
